Procedural Airships
===================

ver. 0.3.0.0 - experimental

This plugin adds procedural airship envelopes to Kerbal Space Program

**!!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!!**
**This will most certainly be full of bugs and breaks savegames/crafts. Only use it for test purposes**

Dependencies:
* swamp_ig's great ProceduralParts mod. Get it [here](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70676-0-24-2WIP-Procedural-Parts-Parts-the-way-you-want-em-0-9-18-Aug-6 "ProceduralParts mod").

Unfortunately it's only possible to save while the ship touches the ground and is extremely slow. So you might want to use KAS for anchoring.

additional notes:

+ This mod contains code from m4v's RCS Build Aid plugin, published under LGPLv3. It's a great plugin, please give it a [try](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-0-24-x-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-5) if you like.
