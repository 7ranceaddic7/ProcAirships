#Procedural Airships

**Version 1.0**

This plug-in adds procedural airship envelopes to Kerbal Space Program.

##Features
-Envelope and ballonet simulation. Including two lifting gas options.
-Supports FAR and NEAR
-Ballast tanks

##Installation

1. Install [ProceduralParts](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70676 "ProceduralParts mod")
2. Copy contents of the GameData folder, provided with this, into your KSPs GameData folder.


##Additional Notes:
Unfortunately it's only possible to save while the ship touches the ground and is extremely slow. So you might want to use KAS for anchoring.
