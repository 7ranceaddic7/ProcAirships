### Mod recommendations

* [Ferram Aerospace Research](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451 "FAR") - I highly recommend this. Feels much more "floaty".
* [Firespitter](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24551 "Firespitter") and/or [KAX](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76668 "KAX") - for prop engines
* [RCS Build Aid](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996 "RCS Build Aid") does not only aid in RCS thruster placement. It is also a great tool for airship engineers. Does your airship experience weird forces causing it to spin around uncontrollably? RCS Build Aid helps.
* [Kerbal attachment System](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514 "KAS") (KAS) contains anchors to keep your airship in place. 
* [Hangar Extender](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65747 "Hangar Extender") - break the boundaries of your SPH to build huge hindenburg-like airships


###Additional Notes:
It is only possible to save, while the ship touches the ground and is very slow. So you might want to use KAS for anchoring.
